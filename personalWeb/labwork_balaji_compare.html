 <br />
  <p>This general introduction of Relaxivity of contrast agents aims to introduce the basic background of the relaxivity of Contrast agents for NMR and MRI application. The knowledge is very basic, which means the main audience are the people who are beginning to be interested in this field. For those who have known such knowledge, please continue to have a look at the influence of different parameters on the relaxivity of CAs (contrast agents) by using the platform in the next tab of the website. This website, which is under the main website made by kelechi nwachukwu, is designed by Weiliang Xing of Balaji Sitharaman’s lab. There are some flashes in this topic, so please allow the plug-in first. The flashes belong to Weiliang Xing and Balaji Sitharaman’s lab.

 <h3> NMR and MRI</h3>
  <p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a physical phenomenon in which magnetic nuclei in a magnetic field absorb and re-emit electromagnetic radiation. This energy is at a specific resonance frequency which depends on the strength of the magnetic field and the magnetic properties of the isotope of the atoms (en.wikipeidia.org).

  <p>The right photo shows the spectroscopy that measures the NMR signals in our lab. Most of the matter you can examine with NMR is composed of molecules which are composed of atoms. Most of the atoms have protons, which maintain positive charge. There are other elements in the atoms, including electrons and neutrons, which have negative and neutral charge. Some proton which has a natural property “spin” could create NMR signals. The spin will be introduced below. NMR is always used to study molecular physics, crystals, and non-crystalline materials. </p></div>

<h3> Spin</h3>
  <p>All nucleons (including proton and neutrons) have the intrinsic quantum property of spin. Spin is just the natural axiomatic property, in other words, just as the mass and electric charge, it is the basic atomic property which cannot be defined by other physical elements. Its behavior is like the ball rotating around the center axis showing in the flash video below. (From the classic physics, it could be visualized as an angular momentum due to the rotation of the nucleus around an axis through its center.) </p>

  <p>For NMR or MRI, the matters which (1) will cause the nucleus to produce an NMR signal and (2) can be thought of as a small magnetic field (http://www.cis.rit.edu/htbooks/nmr/inside.htm) will be regarded having spin property. The overall spin of the nucleus is determined by the spin quantum number S. S could be multiples of ½ and can be positive or negative. Individual electrons, protons or neutrons each has S of ½. The most commonly studied nuclei in NMR experiments are those nuclei with a spin quantum number S=1/2, e.g.  ,  , and so on. The table 1 below shows different elements that have different S.</p>

  <h3> Magnetic resonance by nuclei </h3>
  <p>In a constant magnetic field, the projection of the spin along the rotation axis has a total of 2S+1 possible orientations, which means there are different spin levels. Resonant absorption by nuclear spins will occur only when electromagnetic radiation of certain frequency (so-called Larmor frequency) is applied to match the energy difference between the nuclear spin levels in a constant magnetic field. The magnetic resonance frequencies are related to the magnetic fields and has specific radio frequency (RF) of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is the magnetic resonant absorption which is detected in NMR.

    <p >The flash takes Weiliang Xing, the writer of this website and the flash, as an example. As is known to all, over 70% of human body is water. Each water molecule has one oxygen and two hydrogen, which could generate NMR/MRI signal as explained before. In the normal condition, each water molecule (small balls in the flash) has different orientation of magnetization (remember spin could be regarded as a tiny magnetic field) and totally for human body, there is no magnetization. (Statistically, they are normally distributed). Suppose one day I go to the hospital and have a MRI test. In MRI machine, the major or most expensive part is the magnet to generate a huge constant magnetic field. In the flash, it is marked as B and showed as many orientated arrows. The magnetic field is very strong commonly. Under such orientated constant magnetic field, more water molecule will be arranged again to acquire thermal equilibrium. Take one of them as a general example. Without the magnetic field, the orientation is in the x-y plane for this water molecule in the normal condition. When loaded a new magnetic field B along the z-axis, the water will rotate along the z-axis and eventually reach the z-axis. At equilibrium, the net magnetization vector lies along the direction of the applied magnetic field Bo and is called the equilibrium magnetization At this time, there appears another magnetic pulse in the x-y plane. IF the frequency equals the Lamor Frequency explained before, magnetic resonance happens, which means that the nuclear spin system will rotate back to the plane where the pulse located (such as 1800 and 1200 in the flash). At some point, the value of magnetization in z-axis will not be positive. If at this time the pulse disappears, due to the strong external magnetic field along the z-axis, the spin system will rotate back to z-axis.<strong> The time constant which describes how magnetization along external magnetic field (z-axis) returns to its equilibrium value is called the spin lattice relaxation time (T1). </strong>In addition to the rotation, the net magnetization starts to diphase. <strong>The time constant which describes the return to equilibrium of the transverse magnetization, magnetization along the x-y plane, is called the spin-spin relaxation time, T2.  The whole process is called relaxation process. </strong></p>
  <p>The relaxation (or relaxation time) is affected by many factors, such as the spin density (simply speaking, the number of water molecule is specific tissue), external magnetic field, RF frequency and some intrinsic properties. Thus for normal tissue and abnormal tissue (tumor) in the same location, the relaxation time will be different, which will be shown in the contrast, intensity of output images reconstructed by certain mathematical algorithm. These are the general process and definition of relaxation. </p>
   </div>

   <div id="brief">
  <h3> Contrast agents and relaxivity</h3>
  <p>Contrast agent is one kind of chemicals that could be used in MRI to enhance the quality of MR scan. The most common CAs is gadolinium (Gd III) in the clinical practice. In the 3+ oxidation state the metal has 7 unpaired electrons, which causes water around the contrast agent to relax quickly, and eventually change and improve the contrast and intensity of the area where CAs is distributed. 
  </p>
  <p>Relaxivity of contrast agents (i.e. the change in relaxation rate per unit concentration) refers to the efficiency of a paramagnetic substance to enhance the relaxation rate of water protons, which is the basis of imaging by magnetic resonance. It is an important measure of its efficacy and a quantity whose precise value may affect the accuracy of various measurements of tissue properties such as capillary permeability and blood volume [2] [3]. In reality, the naked metal ion will be very toxic and it will be always linked to some ligand to reduce its toxicity. However, it will reduce the potential to improve relaxivity of CAs. In our lab study, this area is related to the relationship between carbon nanoparticles (nano-graphite, nano-platelet, nano-platelet, nano-ribbons, et al.) and certain metal (Manganese (Mn)) ions to develop the next generation of contrast agents for MRI use. </p>
 
  <p>The main technique is to change the property of the behavior of the CAs at the atomic level. We focus more on several parameters that affect the relaxivity of CAs. The relaxivity of CAs could be described by a series of equation in a theory so-called “Solomon-Bloembergen-Morgan theory”(SBM). There are up to six changeable parameters which may affect the relaxivity. One of our goal is to find the optimal group in certain conditions. For more details of the effect of the six changeable parameters, we make a platform in the next topic to show more directly. Please continue to the next topic, where there are more interesting things to show.  </p>
