  <h3> Abstract:</h3>
  <p> The method in this patent includes optical stimulation device that delivering different wavelength, intensity light and fluid agent to different depths and positions of acupuncture points by optogenectic ways for muscle atrophy rehabilitation is provided. The method controls the wavelength, intensity and targeting point by temperature and electrical feedback sensor control through the optical stimulation device or the acupuncture needle complex. The acupuncture needle described in this method makes optical stimulation to the transfected acupuncture point by light-sensitive ion channel introduction into related cells proximal to the specific muscles including the anterior tibialis muscle in acupuncture point treatment method. Another method is to deliver specific medical agent to the acupuncture point when treating with this acupuncture needle complex to enhance the therapeutic effect. Gene delivery for light-sensitive ion channels is used in the specific acupuncture points.

     <h3>SUMMARY(Part of the patent)</h3>
   <p>
<strong>[0016]</strong> In general, the invention integrates Eastern and Western approaches, by employing the modality of injection to acupuncture points and optogenetic stimulation approaches. The invention describes methods for combining optogenetic stimulation and acupuncture therapy for the rehabilitation of muscle atrophy from an optical stimulation device called. The acupuncture needle complex, in some examples, may deliver optical stimulation to targeted acupuncture point area after gene delivery. For optogenetic modulation, cellular control and interfacing is achieved by activating light-sensitive channel proteins that are embedded in desired certain cell populations proximal to acupuncture point. Opsins are expressed on the cell membrane by vectors including lentiviral or retroviral-based delivery of their genes, realizing direct cellular targeting.
</p>
   <p><strong>[0017]</strong> In certain embodiment of the present invention, two microbial opsins, Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2, cation channel activated by -450 nm light) and Halorhodopsin (NpHR, chloride pump activated by -580 nm light) may be suitable for optogenetic stimulation, as they provide a mechanism to modulate tissue activity especially for neurons by respectively exciting and inhibiting action potentials. And, other suitable opsins are suitable for different medical plan and purposes. </p>
   <p><strong>[0018] </strong>In one aspect, the present invention is a method for introducing optical stimulation comprising transfecting a target acupuncture point with a light-sensitive channel protein sensitive to light in a wavelength range, delivering light in the wavelength range to the target via acupuncture needle complex when the acupuncture therapy is processing, substantially simultaneously sensing bioelectric signals and the effect of heat by light and sending feedback to the processor, determining a patient therapeutic state based on the feedback, and adjusting the delivery of the light to the acupuncture point based on the sensed patient therapeutic state. In some cases, fluid agent delivery is necessary for improving the acupuncture therapy for muscle atrophy.</p>
   <p><strong>[0019]</strong> In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a medical acupuncture device comprising means for generating light, means for controlling the output of generating light, means for directing the light from the means for generating light to specific acupuncture point for muscle atrophy, means for sensing bioelectric signals and thermal effect by means of delivering light, means for controlling the output of generating light to adjust the feedback from the sensors, and means for acupuncture therapy for muscle atrophy accompanying with optogenetic treatment. </p>
   <p><strong>[0020]</strong> In another aspect, the needle of the acupuncture needle complex comprises at least three light-inducers and is adapted to be inserted acupuncture points. The light-inducers arrange in parallel along at least a portion of the axis of the needle. The thin needle may deliver light to many positions along the axis of the needle. This design maximizes the power delivery while minimizing tissue damage during the acupuncture treatment.  During the acupuncture operation, the device is attached to the skin of a patient at the site of particular acupuncture point related to muscle atrophy.</p>
  <p><strong> [0021] </strong>In another aspect, the acupuncture needle complex may be used to deliver an agent topically or subcutaneously. From the description showed below, the reservoir may contain the agent. The agent contained within the reservoir may include a single agent or a combination of agents. In some variations, the agent may comprise a local anesthetic such as lidocaine. The pump may deliver the agent periodically, continuously, or based on a user input according to the processor control. The needle delivers the agent when it is advanced into tissue at or adjacent to an acupuncture point.</p>
<p><strong>[0022]</strong> The above summary of the present invention is not intended to describe each illustrated embodiment or every implementation of the present invention. The details of one or more examples of the invention are set accompanying with pictures and the description below. Extended features, potential application, etc. are also showed from the description and pictures, and from the claims.</p>
